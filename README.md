# Bank_Loan-_Approval_Analysis
# 📊 Loan Approval Analysis 

Hello! I'm excited to share my **first end-to-end data analysis project**, where I explored a loan approval dataset to uncover hidden patterns and create a compelling dashboard using **Power BI**. 🚀

---

## 📁 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a dataset related to **loan applications and approval status**. The goal was to understand **what factors impact loan approvals**—such as income, CIBIL score, employment type, asset value, and more.

I followed the complete data analysis lifecycle:

* 📥 Data Collection (from Kaggle)
* 🧹 Data Cleaning (Python, Jupyter notebook,Pandas)
* 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* 📊 Interactive Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

## 🔍 Steps I Followed

### 1. 🧾 Dataset Collection

* The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), containing over **4000+ loan applications**.
* Key columns included: `income_annum`, `loan_amount`, `cibil_score`, `loan_status`, `education`, `assets`, and more.

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values and corrected data types
* Renamed columns and removed unwanted spaces
* Created new calculated fields (like total asset value, income-to-loan ratio)

### 3. 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

* Analyzed loan approval distribution
* Compared approval rates by education and employment type
* Visualized relationships between income, CIBIL score, and loan amount
* Used **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** to draw histograms, bar plots, scatter plots

### 4. 📊 Power BI Dashboard

Built an **interactive dashboard** that includes:

* 📌 Loan Approval Rate 
* 🎓 Approval by Education & Employment 
* 💰 Income vs Loan Amount 
* 📈 CIBIL Score Distribution (Histogram)
* 🏡 Asset Values of Approved vs Rejected Loans
* 📊 KPI Cards for average income, loan, and approval %

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

* Applicants with **higher CIBIL scores** (>700) had noticeably better approval chances
* **Graduates** and **non-self-employed** individuals were more likely to get loans approved
* There was a clear correlation between **income** and **loan amount applied**
* Asset value alone wasn’t always a strong approval predictor—**credit score was more impactful**
